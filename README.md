# Overview

I have created this project from scratch and all from my memory just to test myself that I could make a very simple program in a very short amount of time.

This software is just for displaying the text I have coded in.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Useful Websites
I didn't use any websites to create this, but w3 schools is always excellent to learn some Python.
